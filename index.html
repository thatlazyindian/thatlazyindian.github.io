        <h1>about me</h1>
        <p>I am a data scientist, currently living in the United States.</p>
        <p>My history with data started when I worked at <a href="https://www.course5i.com" target="_blank">Course5i</a> as a Research Analyst for the Advanced Analytics team, right after my undergraduate. Until then, my only programming experience had been in high school, when I learned a little bit of C++ and Visual Basic. But at Course5i I used R, SPSS and Python, and I was happy to get back to coding. As part of my job, I analyzed and modeled survey data for customer insights in 25+ projects. I took part in standard and ad-hoc studies, process optimizations and automations, new analysts training and supervision, and co-ordinated with the business development team to prepare Proof of Concepts (POCs).</p>
        <p>Inspired by the transformational power I saw data can have while simultaneously aware that I needed to skill-up, I applied and was accepted into Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesotaâ€™s <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-business-analytics/academics/one-year-msba" target="_blank">Masters in Business Analytics</a> program. This one year accelerated program is centered around four pillars of analytics i.e. descriptive, predictive, causal and prescriptive.</p>
        <p>During my time at Carlson, I attended multiple events where I presented my work on <a href="https://medium.com/@nakul_agrawal/understanding-employee-relationships-in-an-organization-using-graph-analytics-2e0a0b3dd32e" target="_blank">Graph Theory</a> and Democratizing Big Data Analysis. I also interned with a B2B2C financial technology start-up where I built a comprehensive solution for customer churn using machine learning models. Some of my projects done at Carlson have been shared on my <a href="https://github.com/thatlazyindian" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
        <p>In August 2020, I joined <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com" target="_blank">Northwestern Mutual (NM)</a>, a Fortune 100 insurance firm. At NM, I create value by providing data-driven thought partnership for NM's strategic initiatives, with a focus on client experience.</p>
