                    <p>I am a data scientist and I am passionate about customer-led growth and analytics.</p>
                    <p>My history with data started at <a href="https://www.course5i.com" target="_blank">Course5i</a> where I worked as a Research Analyst right after my undergraduate. Using randomized experiments and statistics, I modeled survey data to measure consumer perception. I am an engineer at heart and love behavioral economics. I used (then nascent) AI tools (like NLP, computer vision) to develop data-driven products for advertisement and research industries and co-ordinated with the business development team for both pre and post sales activities.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by the transformational power I saw data can have while simultaneously aware that I needed to skill-up, I applied and was accepted into Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota’s <a href="https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/degrees/master-science-in-business-analytics/academics/one-year-msba" target="_blank"> Masters in Business Analytics</a> program. This one year accelerated program is centered around four pillars of analytics i.e. descriptive, predictive, causal and prescriptive. During my time at Carlson, I not only learned crucial analytical skills but I also interned with three start-ups and attended multiple events (in one of them presented my work on <a href="https://medium.com/@nakul_agrawal/understanding-employee-relationships-in-an-organization-using-graph-analytics-2e0a0b3dd32e" target="_blank">Graph Theory</a>). Some of my projects done at Carlson have been shared on my <a href="https://www.nakul-agrawal.com/blog">blog</a>.</p>
                    <p>Post graduation, I joined <a href="https://www.northwesternmutual.com" target="_blank">Northwestern Mutual (NM)</a>, a Fortune 100 insurance firm. During this time, I provided data-driven thought partnership for NM’s strategic initiatives, with a focus on client experience.</p>
                    <p>In August 2023, I joined <a href="https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/index.html" target="_blank">Cisco</a>, where I am responsible for improving customer experience with Cisco’s products and services.
