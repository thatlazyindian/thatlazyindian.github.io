                        I recently started to focus more on my health with near-term goal to lose ~5kgs while maintaining muscle mass. I wasn't particularly having a bad lifestyle earlier, but have increased the intensity of workouts and have been tracking progress using my apple watch.
                        Apple health app provides many metrics but I wanted to track my progress and see the changes compared to previous year in a very specific way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by Github's contribution calendars (which I find to be very intuitive to track habit building), I have exported my raw active energy expenditure and have plotted the progress above. I plan to track this ~once a quarter, since it requires a manual pull, and may decide to automate this someday if it provides enough value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In future, I also plan to track my 'flow' hours i.e., daily amount of time I spend doing things that require single-minded focus.
